# Mycel-client
A rewrite of the [Mycel] client in Go.

## Why?
Go is a compiled lanugage, and thus it allows us to distribute the client as a small executable and discard the Ruby environment. The clients are distributed as Live images over network, and therefore we want them to be as small as possible.
